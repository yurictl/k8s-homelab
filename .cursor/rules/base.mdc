I am working on this project for myself as practice with interesting tools to maintain and improve hard skills. The goal is to get familiar with the current state of MLOps toolsets.

Project structure:
./services - components, containerized. I use them for deployment. Each has a Dockerfile and docker-compose file.
./docs - documentation
