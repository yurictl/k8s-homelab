# Documentation Rules

## Purpose
Document progress and interesting experiments I'm working on. Keep it concise and focused.

## Structure
- `./progress/` - Progress tracking
  - `sprints.md` - General sprint history and overview
  - `sprint-NNN.md` - Detailed sprint documentation with daily progress
- `./guides/` - Technology guides and notes
  - Organized by technology (docker, kubernetes, mlops-tools)
  - Keep guides practical and focused on learnings

## Guidelines
- Only create sections that I explicitly add
- Be concise and to the point
- Focus on practical learnings and experiments
- Document both successes and challenges
- Keep guides updated with current project experience
